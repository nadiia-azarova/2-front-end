                <h1><sup>1</sup>&nbsp;Introduction</h1>
                <p>Welcome to the very start of your React Native journey! If you're looking for environment setup
                    instructions,
                    they've moved to <span>their own section</span>. Continue reading for an introduction to the
                    documentation,
                    Native
                    Components, React, and more!</p>

                <h2><sup>2</sup>&nbsp;Core Components</h2>
                <p>React Native is an open source framework for building Android and iOS applications using React and
                    the app
                    platform‚Äôs native capabilities. With React Native, you use JavaScript to access your platform‚Äôs APIs
                    as well
                    as to describe the appearance and behavior of your UI using React components: bundles of reusable,
                    nestable
                    code. You can learn more about React in the next section. But first, let‚Äôs cover how components work
                    in React
                    Native.</p>

                <h2><sup>3</sup>&nbsp;React Fundamentals</h2>
                <p>React Native runs on React, a popular open source library for building user interfaces with
                    JavaScript. To
                    make the most of React Native, it helps to understand React itself. This section can get you started
                    or can
                    serve as a refresher course.</p>
                <p>We‚Äôre going to cover the core concepts behind React:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>components. The rest of this introduction to React uses cats in its examples: friendly,
                            approachable
                            creatures that need names and a cafe to work in.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>JSX. React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that lets you write elements inside JavaScript
                            like so:
                            &lt;Text&gt;Hello, I am your cat!&lt;/Text&gt;. The React docs have <span>a comprehensive
                                guide to
                                JSX</span> you can
                            refer to
                            learn even more. Because JSX is JavaScript, you can use variables inside it. Here you are
                            declaring a name
                            for the cat, name, and embedding it with curly braces inside &lt;Text&gt;.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>props. Props is short for ‚Äúproperties‚Äù. </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>state. While you can think of props as arguments you use to configure how components render,
                            state is
                            like a component‚Äôs personal data storage. State is useful for handling data that changes
                            over time or that
                            comes from user interaction. State gives your components memory!</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2><sup>4</sup>&nbsp;Handling Text Input</h2>
                <p>TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It has an onChangeText prop that
                    takes a
                    function to be called every time the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop that takes a function
                    to be
                    called when the text is submitted.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating their words into a different
                    language. In
                    this
                    new language, every single word is written the same way: üçï. So the sentence "Hello there Bob" would
                    be
                    translated as "üçï üçï".
